THIS PYTHON CODE IS USED TO GERNATE MOBILE APPLICATION OF EXISTING WEBSITE

like www.google.com or www.menuspk.com (youngstr website )

Simply just create a mobile app for this website 


required 
1. path : where the flutter project will be created
2. name : name of your app / project name
3. domain : write your website domain in reverse order 
4. description : Description of your mobile applicaiton
5. imgPath : path of image that you want to set as mobile application icon 
6. url : URL OF WEBSITE 

lets say you are build mobile application for Youtube (www.youtube.com)
{
    "path": "C:/SALMAN/gits/web_app_cerater/apps",
    "name": "youngstr_youtube",
    "domain": "com.youtube",
    "description": "YOUNGSTR YOUTUBE MOBILE APP",
    "imgPath": "C:/SALMAN/gits/web_app_cerater/app_icons/youtube.png",
    "url": "https://youtube.com"
  },

I have build 2 codes 
1. creater.py for building only 1 Applicaiton 
2. multi_creater.py for building multiple applications (saves a lot of time :) )

and 2 bat files just to run those python code
1. create_menuspk
2. create_all_apps


ALL THEORY PART IS DONE >> 

Mennuspk flutter project is completed now it is building mobile application 
it takes arround 2 minutes for creating app



now lets create YOutbe and Google mobile as well  :) 
inside one python code for creating two mobile applications 
two proccess are used .. for speeding up the task 


NOTE : threads are not used .. reasons i'm opening terminal and changing working directory many times... this can cause issue in running parrallel..


THATS' ALL . JAZZAKALLAH :)
